This is bundle of 7 days to die server configuration which was altered to offer more realistic and rewarding feel.

I presume it could be easily used even if you want to alter your local game.

**There is no more magic block updates like turning one material into another, just enforcing and plating over materials (You can update wood block into wood block reinforced by scrap metal, but not to concrete anymore. The same with doors etc.)**

You'll be sweathing your shirt of while chopping down a tree at first day with very bad tools, but one big tree could offer you a lot of wood for day or two.
You'll not be swimming in pools of Golden Rot or cotton anymore, there will not be garbage sacks everywhere..
If you'll find cooking pot, beaker or grill first day, you can consider yourself VERY lucky.
And many more.
This will be probably very quickly updated by newer 7dtd versions and updated by more changes..

**INSTALATION**:

*  copy over your configurations
*  regenerate your world (or create new game if you play locally)

**RECOMMMENDED WORLD SETTINGS:**

*  Random gen in multiplayer or singleplayer
*  Block durability 700% - not i am not mad, alpha 13.5 came with new changes (stone axe is much more powerfull and the game will be arcade bellow) 600% right now is great ballance to have difference between bare hands and stone axe at level 1 and other better tools.. You'll dont want to return to 100% if you try to play with this for one day...
*  Loot abundance 15%
*  Loot respawn delay: disable (or set to something like 99999 days)
*  Length of one day: 180 minutes (3 real time hours) everything is perfectly balanced to be so, you'll see..
*  14 hours of daylight as it means night from 22:00 to 8:00
*  Difficulty: Survivalist
*  enemy Sense memory: 120 seconds
*  Lowest Spawn rate available (currently 50%)

Other options are up to you.

Enjoy!
